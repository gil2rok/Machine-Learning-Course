# Machine-Learning-Course
My code for Andrew Ng's online Machine Learning course assignments

The link to the code is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). It teaches the basics of ML, 
covering linear regression, logistic regression, basic linear algebra, regularization, neural networks, ML system design, SVMs, 
unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, anamoly detection, and recommender systems.

I'm currently halfway through.
